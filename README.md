# ChronWard - EVCharge
EVCharge is a Work-Based Learning (WBL) project which is being managed by Faculty of Organization and Informatics (FOI) and IT company SICK Mobilisis. Project was started for educational purposes for a class called Analysis and Development of Applications.  

The sole purpose of the project is to simulate charging of personal electric vehicles using RFID cards which are scanned with a mobile phone NFC reader. To achieve this goal we will implement an Android mobile application which will be used to simulate a charger and will have functionalities of managing the RFID cards that user can scan to authenticate themselves and start or stop charging. Also, we will implement a Web application that will be used as a managment and administration system for admins and will have a map so casual users can also find the the chargers more easily.

## Technologies

Android - android will be used as a operating system where the mobile application will be running

Flutter - flutter is the framework that will be used with dart for front-end in the mobile app development

PostgreSQL - PostgreSQL is a RDBMS that will be used for the implementation of this project

JavaScript, CSS, React, npm - All of the mentioned are the programming languages and technologies that will be used to achieve the implementation of the Web app

.Net (C#) - Platform that will be used to build the backend

Docker - we will use docker container for deploying

## Software

Android Studio - IDE that will be used for the development of the mobile application. 

GitHub - used as a version control system

Jira and Confluence - project management tools that will be used during the whole duration of the project. Jira will be used for issue and sprint planning, assigning different tasks to different team members etc. Confluence will be used as a team wiki so the members can always track the meeting notes and have different models and parts of the project available in a visual form and textual form or the purpose of reviewing and analysing. 

Visual Studio Code - code editor that will be mainly used for implementing the web application and some parts of the mobile application.

Visual Studio - IDE used for backend programming with .Net (C#)

## Hardware
Personal computers and mobile devices - development, testing and simulation

RFID card - scanning and authenticating the user before having access to charging station

## Platform
Target platforms: Android 8.0+ device


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
